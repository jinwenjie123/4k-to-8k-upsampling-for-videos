# 4k-to-8k-upsampling-for-videos

This project is aiming to upsample the 4k videos to 8k videos.
We tried the combination between 3 different color spaces and 3 different upsampling methods and tried to pick which pair is the best one.

# For our code, please open our folder"MATLAB code" with a happy face
